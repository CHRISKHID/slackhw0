                <h2>Italian Soda at Bytes</h2>
                <h3>A Floor, GetFund Hostel, UENR</h3>

            <p>
                An Italian soda is a soft drink made from carbonated water and simple syrup, usually 
                flavored. Flavors can be fruit (e.g. cherry, blueberry) or modeled after the flavors 
                of desserts, spices, or other beverages (e.g. amaretto, chai, chocolate). 
                Some vendors add cream to the drink as well.

                Despite its name, Italian soda originated in the United States. One claimant to the 
                introduction and increased popularity of Italian sodas is Torani: Rinaldo and Ezilda 
                Torre brought recipes for flavored syrups from Lucca, Italy and in 1925 introduced what 
                become known as an Italian soda to the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco, 
                California. The Italian-American association with Italian sodas has been reinforced by 
                various ready-made brands of Italian sodas, such as the 2005 creation of Romano's Italian 
                Soda Company (named after the Italian-American grandfather of the company's founder) 
                and the 2007 introduction of "The Sopranos Old Fashioned Italian Sodas" which come in 
                three flavors: limoncello, amaretto, and Chianti.
                <p><strong>Recommendation: </strong>Raspberry Italian Soda</p>

                <p>
                    Bubble tea (also known as pearl milk tea, bubble milk tea, or simply boba) 
                    is a Taiwanese tea-based drink invented in Tainan and Taichung in the 1980s.
                    Recipes contain tea of some kind, flavors of milk, as well as sugar (optional). 
                    Toppings, such as chewy tapioca balls (also known as pearls, or boba), popping boba, 
                    fruit jelly, grass jelly, agar jelly, and puddings are often added. Ice-blended versions 
                    are frozen and put into a blender, resulting in a slushy consistency. There are many 
                    varieties of the drink with a wide range of flavors. The two most popular varieties are 
                    black pearl milk tea and green pearl milk tea. "Boba" is Cantonese slang for "large 
                    breasts" referring to the tapioca balls.
                
                    <p><strong>Recommendation: </strong>Classic Milk Tea with tapioca + an order of popcorn chicken.</p>

                <p>
                        A latte is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk.

                        The term as used in English is a shortened form of the Italian caffè latte, 
                        caffelatte or caffellatte, which means "milk coffee". The word is also sometimes 
                        spelled latté or lattè in English with different kinds of accent marks, which can be 
                        a hyperforeignism or a deliberate attempt to indicate that the word is not pronounced 
                        according to the rules of English orthography.

                        <p><strong>Recommendation: </strong>Vanilla Bean Latte</p>

                <p>
                    Aguas frescas (Spanish for "cool waters", or literally "fresh waters") are light non-alcoholic 
                    beverages made from one or more fruits, cereals, flowers, or seeds blended with sugar and 
                    water. They are popular in Mexico and the United States. Some of the more common flavors 
                    include tamarind, hibiscus, and horchata.

                    Aguas frescas are sold by street vendors, but can also be found in bodegas (convenience stores), 
                    restaurants and juice bars.
                    <p><strong>Recommendation: </strong>Agua Fresca</p>
